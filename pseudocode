Create flowchart and pseudocode for the following:
Input a year and find whether it is a leap year or not.
Take two numbers and print the sum of both.
Take a number as input and print the multiplication table for it.
Take 2 numbers as inputs and find their HCF and LCM.
Keep taking numbers as inputs till the user enters ‘x’, after that print sum of all

1
-------------------------------------
start
accept year as input
check if year is divisible by 4
if yes: then check if year is divisible by 100
                    if yes: then check if it is divisible by 400
                                      if yes: then it is a leap year
                    if not: then it is not a leap year
if not it is not a leap year.
stop



2
-------------------------------------
start
accept 2 numbers a and b as input
save a+b in var c
print c
stop


3
------------------------------------
start
accept a number 'a' as input
for every number from 1-10 (for loop construct) print a*i 
print a new line for each iteration
stop

4
-----------------------------------
start
accept 2 numbers a and b as input
take the smaller number of the both using min function
while i is less than min print hcf=i, if both a%i and b%i  ==0
take the bigger number of the 2 using max function
while i is greater than or equal to the bigger number, i is the lcm if both i%a and i%b ==0
stop

5
--------------------------------
start
initialise a=[] #empty list
while i is not equal to 'x', i=input(), a.append(i)
print(sum(a))
stop
